# FEISummer2021ContractStrictnessProject

## Summary
This repository contains scripts for my summer 2021 internship with Claremont Mckenna College's Financial Economics Institute. I was assigned to work with Professor George Batta on his Contract Strictness Research Project which attempts to measure non-price credit terms such as EBITDA, Net Income, and Liens with respect to Financial and Negative Covenants. The project is still ongoing and will be finished by the end of 2021 or the beginning of 2022.

## Accomplishments
A few of my contributions to the the project include.
- Constructed a database for over 30 corporate credit agreements using R in preparation for
developing a machine learning model used to potentially predict corporate credit bubbles
- Categorized 5 corporate credit agreements, specifically financial covenant thresholds,
negative covenant definitions, and deductibles and carve-outs for numerous restrictions in
order to provide project training and testing data
- Built a natural language processing algorithm using Python, scikit-learn, and Spacy to
establish a mapping between contract language and research analyst credit agreement
categorizations
